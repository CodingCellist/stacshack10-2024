# 8-Bit Goal Tracker -- StacsHack 10 2024

This project was created for the 10th StacsHack, 2024-03-02 to 2024-03-03.

Since the theme was "8-Bit" (taken at random from the past 9 themes), my
original idea was a JRPG-style inventory management system for financial assets
(BlackRock had a "financial literacy" challenge). However, it turns out those
are work, and I have never done any React, so with a good night's sleep and 2
hours to go, I instead decided to quickly hack together a goals tracker.
Buttons, text-fields, and forms; those I at least understand  ^^


## FAQ

* Does it work? Yes (which I'm honestly surprised by)
* Can you delete goals? No, that would be defeatist; don't let your memes be
    dreams!
